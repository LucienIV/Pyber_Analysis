# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to take ridesharing data for a set of cities and analyze the statistics for the city set grouped by rural, suburban, and urban types of cities over a period of time. This data was then used to create a summary dataframe and a line chart to visually display the results of the analysis. 

## Results

### Overall Dataframe

The dataframe compiling the information for each city type is as follows:

As can be seen, as the type of city changes from rural to suburban to urban the number of rides and drivers increases. Naturally, this also results in a larger total amount of fares for urban cities than the other types. Conversely, this means that as cities move from urban to suburban to rural the average fare per ride and driver increase. Most notably, the average fare per driver in rural cities is almost $40 higher than it is in urban cities due to the much smaller number of available drivers. 

### Line Graph for Four Month Span

The following line graph is a compilation of the data for a period between 01/01/19 and 04/28/19:


The graph visually displays the same conclusions that can be reached from the earlier dataframe. Urban cities have higher fare totals than suburban cities, which in turn have a higher total than rural cities. There are small changes to each line over time, but nothing of such a magnitude that it causes any line to intersect with abother for the observed period. At least from this data it can be determined that time of year impacts the amount of fares in a given city but that on the whole the cities that are urban will have a higher total fare amount.
